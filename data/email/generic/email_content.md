Hi [FIRST_NAME]!

Can you believe that it's already been a year since we started Dev Together!? &#xe312; &#x1f92f; &#xe312;

To celebrate and thank you for your involvement this past year, we would like to personally invite you to our 1-year anniversary celebration next month taking place at 1871 and generously sponsored by [Alpha Particle](https://alphaparticle.com). Food will be provided and is sponsored by [Tandem](https://madeintandem.com). It won't be pizza, I promise! Thank you to both of our sponsors!

We know what sets our events apart is our community and its committment to experiential learning. So for next month's anniversary, we're staying true to our roots. We'll be having a unit testing and Heroku deployment code-along on an Appreciation Station project that recognizes you and your involvement this past year. We'll learn what a unit test is, how to write them for React, and celebrate everything we've achieved as a community. 

The event will take place Tuesday, June 11 from 6pm - 7:30pm. We really hope you can join us!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out! The best place to reach me is in the Chicago Tech Slack. If you haven't already joined, you should! It's a great way to stay plugged in to what is going on in Chicago tech. [Sign up here](http://www.chicagotechslack.com/) and **be sure to join the new #devtogether channel** where you can find me and others in our community.

While we're talking aboout Slack, Chicago has another great Slack community called the [Chicago Tech Diversity Initiative](http://www.chitechdiversity.com/) that I can't recommend highly enough.

Have a great day!
