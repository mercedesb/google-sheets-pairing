**What should I do before next week?**

Your Mentor will be reviewing your code prior to next [EVENT_DAY]'s event. Your Mentor may submit a pull request with feedback to your repo, but you do not need to take any action if they do. At the event, there will be an hour for you to pair with your Mentor where they will explain their feedback and start to work through some of their suggestions with you.

**What should I bring?**

Make sure to bring your laptop and have a working development environment so that you can pair program on the code you submitted with your Mentor.
